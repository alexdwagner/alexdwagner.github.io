# Writing

Here's a list of things that I've written:

- Don't Do What I Did: A book about how to avoid the mistakes that I made while working in film and video production.
- My UX Writing/Content Strategy Portfolio: Professional work, mostly doing content and UX writing for tech and crypto organizations.
- School for Poetic Computation Blog (Fall 2016): Daily blog chronicling my experience at SFPC.
