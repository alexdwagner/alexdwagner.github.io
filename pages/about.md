**About me, in three bullet points:**

* **I'm a full-stack web developer based in , Brooklyn, New York.** I specialize in building responsive websites with JavaScript and React. I also have experience with Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Solidity, and p5.js. I love Tailwind.

* **I'm from Dallas, Texas**. Go Rangers! I've called Brooklyn home for the past 10 years.

* **I write a Substack called [Things That Should Exist](https://thingsthatshouldexist.substack.com/)**. It started as an exploration of "how to buy land with your friends" and has evolved into a newsletter about belonging, collective power, and a sort-of journal for things I've been working on.

<!-- I spend my free time [skateboarding](https://youtu.be/9YsUplV-MJ0), [playing music with my friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcnQQiexLQ), and basking in the glory of nature 🏕️. -->

In my free time, I like to read, bake bread, and work on side projects that interest me. Recently, I've been playing with various open source LLMs. I also play the guitar and write music.

<!-- I also make [art and music](/artwork/). -->
