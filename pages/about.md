**About me, in three bullet points:**

* **In my 20's, I was a [video cameraman and editor](https://vimeo.com/155482272?share=copy)**.

* **I'm from Dallas, Texas**. People tell me I don't have an accent but if you hang out with me long enough you'll hear it. Right now, I live in Brooklyn, New York.

* **I write a Substack called [Things That Should Exist](https://thingsthatshouldexist.substack.com/)**. It started as an exploration of "how to buy land with your friends" and has evolved into a newsletter about belonging, collective power, and a sort-of journal for things I've been working on.

I spend my free time [skateboarding](https://youtu.be/9YsUplV-MJ0), [playing music with my friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMcnQQiexLQ), and basking in the glory of nature üèïÔ∏è.

<!-- I also make [art and music](/artwork/). -->
