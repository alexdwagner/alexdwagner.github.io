# Minimum Viable Style Guide

## Blog

* All Headers in Title Case
* Avoid starting sentences with verbal tics such as conjunctions (and, but, etc)
* Provide links throughout piece, especially for new concepts or specific examples. Links should be reputable. Wikipedia is ok.
* Each piece should go through two revisions in the Myosin Editorial Process(to be written as of 2/10/22).
* When in doubt, refer to Mailchimp’s style guide for guidance.
* Keep sentences and paragraphs short and readable. Use white space. Brevity = soul of wit. 
* Reading comprehension plummets after eight words in a sentence. Write accordingly. Brian Dean’s writing is a good example of very readable blog content. You don’t have to go to that extreme. 
* Generally, paragraphs should be the size of your thumb, and sentences should be less than 25 words.

## Twitter

* Posting memes is good. Vet memes with SOB team before posting.
* Threads are good.
* Voice should be casual, but not “surfer-casual”. The Myosin twitter voice playful, sardonic, mischievous, knowing, sometimes challenging. 
* Use punctuation, use abbreviations when needed but avoid over-abbreviating(“r” for “are”, u for “you”, etc)

## Editorial Process

* Every blog post goes through a minimum of two complete revisions. Content Editor will give notes and ultimate approval on a finished piece to Content Writer. Content Writer will input complete post into platform (Mirror, Substack, etc) and save as draft. Content Editor will schedule publish date and hit publish.
* Add 2-5 tweet embeds to each blog post to add social proof to points in blog and increase likelihood of blog post generating organic conversations in the world. 
* Ideally, work to promote the post will be done before the post is published, and the author will reach out to three people who they think the post would be of interest to. Author will share first or second draft with each of the three and ask for feedback and if they will make a tweet about the post. Author will ask, “What does the post need to cover for you to make a tweet about it?”
* To do: Create an outreach guide for post authors to seed promotion of post
* Generate post ideas based on real conversations, from voice chat, Twitter, Discord, help requests, etc. Draw ideas from Product Notion pages such as Customer Insights as often as possible.
