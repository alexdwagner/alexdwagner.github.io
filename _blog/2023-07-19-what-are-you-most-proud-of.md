I came across this question on Twitter and thought it would be a good one to answer here.

**What have you done in the realm of the creator economy / internet that you are most proud of?**

I've had a lot of interesting conversations as a result of my [Substack](https://thingsthatshouldexist.substack.com). 

Through it, I've made new friends and pen pals, been invited to visit people across the US, and even stayed with some of them while traveling.

I'm really proud of this documentary that got published in Dallas' only alt-weekly as an article:

I made a short film that got my puppeteer friend, Will, a short role in a Jon Favreau movie:

I wrote a book on my experiences working in film production called "Don't Do What I Did":

And this tweet asking people how they would "buy land with their friends":
