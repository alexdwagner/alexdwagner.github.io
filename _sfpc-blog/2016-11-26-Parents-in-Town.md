Went to the Met Museum with my parents. Showed them around SFPC, and then they took us out to a real nice dinner at a tapas place.

<h2>Later</h2>

Stayed at a really terrible Airbnb. The plumbing broke and the tub was leaking everywhere. It was rated 4 stars! C'mon!

This was taken upon leaving. The outside patio area.

Never again.
