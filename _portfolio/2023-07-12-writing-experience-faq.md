*Some of the questions I've been asked in previous roles, and my answers to them.*

### Do you have experience creating technical content for complex platforms? 

Yes! I’ve been creating technical content for complex platforms for 6+ years. I created help documentation for Equeum, which provides institutional-grade data analytics for an array of assets. I lead a team to create a 50-article knowledge base while working at Friends With Benefits. I also owned the content function while I was at Sobol, and shipped numerous pieces of content that analyzed the governance processes and workflows of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations(DAOs).

### Do you have experience creating content strategies for complex platforms? 

Huge yes. As I said, I owned this function at Sobol. While there, I created a six-month multi-channel content strategy from scratch, and published technical content and long-form "thought piece” content to establish brand awareness and drive new conversations with new enterprise customers and DAOs. While at Sobol, I also established the Sobol Discord server, and created our code of conduct for our Discord community. I was solely responsible for Trust and Safety in our Discord community.

As the Editor-in-Chief for the Gitcoin newsletter(sent to 120k readers weekly), I built the content strategy for that product and shipped weekly for six months, implementing a/b-testing, key metrics, and iterating based on shifting organizational needs and feedback from stakeholders.

### Do you have experience working with engineers and/or product managers to create technical documentation? 

Yes. At Sobol, I was the only non-engineer on a team of ten, save for the founders. I worked with the Sobol engineering team to publish help documentation, release notes, and UX copy.

At Equeum, I was given a project to re-write all of the products error messages to make them more understandable and actionable to users. I worked daily with team engineers to understand and analyze the error messages. I then presented my findings to stakeholders, and worked with the engineers to re-write the highest-priority error messages first. We re-wrote 200+ error messages.

### Do you have experience creating technical, user, and/or training content for a workflow platform?

Yes! Sobol is a workflow platform, and I created numerous training materials for our users, including help docs, screen recordings, and client-specific process documentation to fit the clients’ particular needs and workflows.

In a previous life(10 years ago), I was a video editor, and produced educational video courses on the technical aspects of crowdfunding. I produced three of these courses, while working alongside the client.

### Do you have previous experience as a Content or Technical Writer at Google?  

I have created technical content while being employed by Google, while working as a content creator for Hyphen Labs. Hyphen Labs was accepted into Google’s Jigsaw incubator to develop a VR training experience for law enforcement to learn de-escalation and non-violent tactics in interacting with people of color.
