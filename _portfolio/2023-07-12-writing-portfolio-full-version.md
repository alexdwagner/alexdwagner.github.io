### **Gitcoin – Newsletter Editor and Content Writer**

_July 2022 - Jan 2022_

For four months(15 issues), I owned and shipped the weekly Gitcoin newsletter that was sent out to ~120k subscribers. The newsletter served to keep readers up-to-date on governance decisions, new Gitcoin products(grants 2.0, Gitcoin Passport, etc), upcoming hackathons, and other news in the Gitcoin/greenpill/public goods spaces. I tracked the open rate from week-to-week as the “north star” metric, and ran an a/b-test each week to experiment with ways of increasing the open rate and subscriber base. We used Hubspot as our email platform.

### **Sobol – Content and Community Lead**

_November 2021 - June 2022_

I owned content and community functions for [Sobol](https://sobol.io/), DAO tooling company, incubated by [Consensys Mesh](https://www.mesh.xyz/team).

### **Pico Case Studies**

Pico is a SaaS company that offers a tool for independent publications to streamline membership and community activities. I researched and wrote three long-form pieces for them, for SEO and case study use. 

I conducted interviews with the founders of three digital newspapers and asked them about the landscape of independent journalism and how their software stack affects their day-to-day operations.

## **Copywriting Work**


### **FWB New Member Application Web App – Copywriter**

_July 2021 - September 2021_

For two months, attended regular meetings and served as Copywriter for design of FWB’s new member application web app. Contributed several drafts of UX copy and to discussions regarding design thinking behind the app and its place in the new user onboarding flow.

### **FWB Member Directory – Product Research Survey**

_August 2021_

Lead stakeholder Alex Zhang tasked me with creating a survey to send out to FWB members to determine what the community wants from the FWB Member Directory app.

I worked with the Product team to draft a list of questions, and then created a form in Airtable. The form was sent out to the community and 300+ responses were collected.

Two weeks later, I worked with two other contributors to analyze and present the results to Head Designer, Mike Bodge, and the Product team.
