<!-- # Alex Wagner
## Full-Stack Web Developer -->

## **Hi, I'm Alex.** 

### **I'm a [full-stack web developer](https://github.com/alexdwagner) based in Brooklyn, New York.**

I have experience building with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React, Next.js, Node/Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Python, and P5.js.

**Here's what I'm ["building in public"](https://publiclab.co/building-in-public/what-is-it) right now:**

* **SoundHaven:** Currently building "Figma for musicians". SoundHaven is an open source webapp that allows users to upload audio files, add markers and comments, and share files and playlists. Currently a work in progress. I am aiming to launch a working version in Spring 2024. 

    Built with React, Next.js, Typescript, Nest.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

* **Context AI:** Context is an AI-driven "learning ecosystem" that teaches you [creative coding](https://p5js.org/). Context generates a personalized learning path to help you learn creative coding. There is a "office hours mode" where you can chat with a persona who converses with you based on your preferred learning style. There is also a "practice mode" that generates learning exercises that teach you core concepts in creative coding.

    Update: Context AI is live! [Check it out here.](https://context-learn.com/)

<!-- * **[CodeFriends](https://github.com/alexdwagner/code-friends):** A mentorship platform for developers. CodeFriends allows you to connect with mentors and peers who can help you learn to code, as well as navigate the process of finding a job. Built with React, Next.js, TailwindCSS.

* **[Things That Should Exist](https://thingsthatshouldexist.substack.com/):** A newsletter about belonging, collective power, and a sort-of journal for things I've been working on. *[Read it here.](https://thingsthatshouldexist.substack.com/archive)* -->
